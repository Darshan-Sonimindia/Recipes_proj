    <p>These crispy savory cakes are a unique and tasty way to enjoy daikon radish. 
        Like an Asian twist on a modified latke recipe. 
        If you like spiciness and the bitter taste of radish, you'll love this recipe. 
        If not, give it a try anyway, dipped in ketchup, sour cream, miso mayo, jam, or whatever floats your boat.
